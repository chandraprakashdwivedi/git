1. Fork the repository

2. Set up login and ssh keys for your git account.

3. Clone repository to your machine.

4. create your own branch and set upstream to the remote repository.

 #git remote add upstream git@github.com:remote-repository/repo.git
 
 #git remote -v

This will fetch code to your local

 #git fetch --all
 
 #git checkout origin development  #To change your current origin
 
 #git pull upstream development    #To fetch out code for the particular branch
 
 or create your local branch and copy on that 
 
  #git checkout -b cp upstream/development
  
  Where development is the remote branch which you are copying to you 'cp' branch
  
5. Now checkout to your branch and work on that.

#git checkout development

or if you have your own local branch
#git checkout -b cp

6. Now everytime when you want to sync code to your branch.

#git fetch --all 

#git checkout origin development

#git pull upstream development

7. To commit and give pull request (PR) for changes.

#git add . && git commit -am "[YOUR COMMIT NOTES]" && git push origin [BRANCH_NAME] 

#git request-pull master upstream   //not working need to give the pull request from UI

 Where cp is your branch from which you are giving the pull request
